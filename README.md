This project began as a way to test low latency network systems for use with high frequency trading. Since then, it has transformed from optimizing a packet process algorithm into a study of ethernet packets over TCP sockets in virtual machines. How to set up a network between virtual machines has provided me with a greater understanding of how virtualized servers in the cloud set up their internet and communicate with one another. Additionally, this system has future use for virtualization of the CPU to complete synchronous or asynchronous processes. A future use case could be a testing environment of high frequency trading. 

The report and final powerpoint can be found in the /docs directory, and the final video is in the root directory.

Hope you enjoy! Feel free to email me with any questions or comments: richard.b.arledge@vanderbilt.edu
